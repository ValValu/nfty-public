quite a few things gutted for privacy/security. will need to be fixed to be used and code is awful anyway. funny that this shit still outperforms most opensea bots yet it hasn't been touched for months. there are also a lot of leftover/unfinished things in this that are either incredibly wrong or just stupid, this entire project was a major learning experience and my first deep dive into the entire eth ecosystem and i just got lazy and didn't want to write good code just code that worked.
